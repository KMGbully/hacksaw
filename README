# Uses a variety of open-source tools to automate initial testing on Internal and External Penetration Tests:
# 1.  Identifies open ports and services in a staged format for quicker results
# 2.  Enumerates services and identifies known exploitable vulnerabilities
# 3.  Identifies misconfigurations and known vulnerable components in web applications
# 4.  Takes screen shots of all scanned websites
# 5.  Conducts password auditing on common services for default, null, or easily guessable 
#     passwords
# 6.  Exports all nmap and metasploit outputs to an engagement directory in txt, xml, and html formats
# 7.  Creates a metasploit workspace, imports results, and exports the workspace 
#     and creds to the engagement directory.
# 8.  All outputs are parsed and returned to a master text document and html file for easy viewing.
